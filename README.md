# Exceptional

It is an Android application written in Kotlin.
The user has to log in with their Facebook account to use it.
After the login, users can throw various Java, .NET and submitted exceptions to each other.
All thrown and catched exceptions are stored for the user, and these exceptions can be seen
in the exception history, or can be viewed on a map, showing their throw location.
Users can attach yes-no questions to exceptions before they throw it, and the catching peer
has to answer it. 
Users also can submit an exception type every week, and also have one vote. At the end of each 
week, the winner exception of the submitting contest becames throwable by everyone.
